When we use matlab function plotyy, it's inconvenient to setup the labels and ranges of the three axes and the legend of the two lines. What's more, plotyy can not be used in some cases, for example,if the target axes is a child of a uipanel. layerplot enables one who has little knowledge about the graphics handle to plot two lines with two y-axis in one figure and easily setup the corresponding axes properties.
