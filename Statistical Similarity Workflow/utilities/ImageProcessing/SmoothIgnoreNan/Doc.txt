Description 	

NDNANFILTER N-dimensional zero-phase digital filter, ignoring NaNs.
 
SHORT SYNTAX:
[Y,W] = ndnanfilter(X,HWIN,F);
 
SHORT INPUT:
X - Multidimensional data with/without NaNs.
HWIN - Window's name (N-D moving average by default: 'rectwin').
F - Vector specifying the semi-width of the window for each dimension.

SHORT OUTPUT:
Y - Filtered/smoothed X data (same size as X!) with zero phase shift.
W - N-dimensional window with central symmetry generated by a special subfunction called NDWIND.
 
SHORT DESCRIPTION:
This function applies a N-dimensional convolution of X with W, using the MATLAB's IMFILTER or CONVN function, ignoring/interpolating/filling NaNs.

By default, the edges are padded with the values of X at the borders with the PADARRAY MATLAB's function. When PADARRAY is not found, the program performs zero-padding.

SHORT NOTE:
